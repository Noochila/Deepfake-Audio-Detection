# DeepFake Audio Detection using MFCC
This repository contains the codebase for detecting DeepFake audio using MFCC (Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients). The goal of this project is to provide a reliable and efficient method for identifying manipulated or synthetic audio generated by DeepFake algorithms.

## Installation

To install and run this codebase on your machine, please follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/noochila/DeepFake-Audio-Detection-MFCC.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```
    cd DeepFake-Audio-Detection-MFCC
    ```

3. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   - On Windows:
     ```
     python -m venv venv
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On Linux/Mac:
     ```
     python3 -m venv venv
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

4. Install the required dependencies:
